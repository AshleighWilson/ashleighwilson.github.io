This post is a starting point for my blog and serves as a demonstration of some of the functionality available.

## Code Snippets

An example of a C++ code snippet below.

```cpp
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int main() 
{
    cout << "Hello, World!";
    return 0;
}
```

## MathJax Integration

MathJax allows math equations to be added to the website. 


When $$a \ne 0$$, there are two solutions to $$ax^2 + bx + c = 0$$ and they can be determined by:

$$x = {-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac} \over 2a}$$
