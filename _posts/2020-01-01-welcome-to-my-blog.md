This post is a starting point for my blog and serves as a demonstration of some of the functionality available.

## Code Snippets

An example of a C++ code snippet below.

```cpp
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int main() 
{
    cout << "Hello, World!";
    return 0;
}
```

## MathJax Integration

MathJax allows math equations to be added to the website. 


Inline equations are possible, i.e. $$ax^2 + bx + c = 0$$, as well as ones on separate lines:

$$x = {-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac} \over 2a}$$

It is possible to omit the equation number if needed.

$$ \int_0^\infty \frac{x^3}{e^x-1}\,dx = \frac{\pi^4}{15} \nonumber $$

We can also reference equations, such as equation \eqref{Einstein}.

$$ E=mc^2 \label{Einstein} $$
